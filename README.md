Development Strategy
Approach
Top to Bottom & Outside-In
The development started with the outermost layout components, such as the header and hero section, and moved inward. This approach helps maintain a clear visual hierarchy and simplifies component styling.
Header/Hero Section
The first task involved creating the header and hero components.
Key assets, such as images and icons, were used to enhance the visual appeal of the hero section.
Assets
All images and assets used in the project can be found in the images_.zip archive.
